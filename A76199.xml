            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:112156:3"/>the practice of a Noble hand, and of approved Abilities (to teſtifie how ready I am to further ingenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous undertakings in this kind) I have with much pains, and ſome charges, ſought after, and at length happily purchaſed them for you. Al which, with the addition of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Secrets of ſeveral kinds, (and I hope, of valuable concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) I have ſo incorporated together, if I may ſo ſay, and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodically digeſted, that they may be the more eaſily and profitably improved.</p>
            <p>And leſt any thing might yet be lacking on my part, I have cauſed ſomewhat like an alphabetical Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be affixed to every part, by the help whereof you may quickly view the particulars of your Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury,

            <p>The whole Cabinet conſiſteth of three Diviſions, in each where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are contained many pleaſant and precious pieces of different kinds, both for ornament and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit. In the firſt you ſhall find a delightful Confectionary of Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, Conſerves, Candies, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rups and ſuch like, and how to make and uſe them. In the ſecond you may take notice of very many and rare Secrets in nature, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both to Phyſick and Chirur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery, not unworthy the knowledg and practice of moſt piercing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tits.

            <p>The moſt ſtately of the three is
<pb facs="tcp:112156:4"/>that in the midſt; the more delight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are ſet on each ſide: This like a magnificent palace, ſtands above them; theſe like places of pleaſure, ſtand about it: Here you may ſport, there you may reſt; Theſe are for pomp, the other for ſafety. But leſt I ſhould be thought tedious to little purpoſe, or any way to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to byaſſe your affections, or abridg your freedom, I ſhall thus leave you at liberty as Lovers in Gardens, to follow your own fancies.

                  <p>The manner of uſing theſe is this: When you feel the pain begin to come, take two Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of thoſe Pils in the morning faſting, one day after another; or if you will, reſt a day

                  <p>Take a long pot of ſtone that is very wel glazed, with the neck a foot and half long, and that hath a very narrow mouth, as is poſſible, and put therein two or three pound of Quick-ſilver, then ſet the ſame pot in a ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let of Iron, and lute them cloſe together, and ſet it upon a furnace, and give them fire accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to art, until the Quick-ſilver remain cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cined; having ſpecial care that your head and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver be very wel luted, leſt you loſe ſome part of the Quick ſilver; and thus in eight daies it ſhal be finiſhed, which ſhall be apt for ſolution.

Now the ſteam of the pot paſſing thorow the pipe under the falſe bottom of the bathing tub, (which muſt be bored ful of big holes) will breath ſo ſweet and warme a vapour upon your body, as that (receiving air by holding your head without the tub, as you ſit therein) you ſhal ſweat moſt temperately, and continue the ſame without fainting.

The firſt water that is white is called <hi>Aqua del Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamo,</hi> or a Balm water, and the oyl ſeperated from that is called <hi>Oleum del Balſamo,</hi> or oyl of Balm. The ſecond water that is black, is called <hi>Mater del Balſamo,</hi> or mother of Balm, and the oyle ſeparated from that water is called <hi>del Balſamo artificiato,</hi> or artificial Balme;
